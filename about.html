     <h1>About.</h1>
     <p>My real name is John but people have always called me Jack. Kind of like JFK, even though his name was John everyone who really knew
      him called him Jack. I was born and raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota and after graduating high school I went to the University of North Dakota at Grand Forks.
      I origionally was a petroleum engineering student and was planning on trying my hand at being a drilling/production engineer in the Bakken. Oil prices crashed however
      and things were not looking good so I switched to Electrical Engineering with a computer science focus which turned into a double major in Electrical Engineering and computer science.
      After taking a few classes in computer science and doing self-study on my own I have found that I have quite a knack for programming. I am currently looking for employment as a Software Engineer.
      I have two specialties which are Web development and Embedded software engineering (as crazy as that may sound). If you like what you see here and want to get in touch feel free to contact me in <thead>
      contact section.
